1. Plasma_Dispersion_Utilities contains several notebooks that provide dispersion tensor 
and dispersion relation routines as well as notebooks for checking and plotting them.

2.  There are several directories containing notebooks in which the utilities above or used
to look at wave dispersion of some specific machines and specific cases.
